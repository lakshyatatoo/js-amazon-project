creating the html and css layout and stylong it so products are added in div as a grid layout and then 
js is appleid where we create a object with all the data of products and when we run the file we generate htmk or products using object properties.
so we can add any product and genrate it without filling up our html file


REAL WORLD WEBSITTE does not write it generates html 

git history can be seen for each file called version history


//cart
it is nothng but a list with products stored as object elements ans we can few data and generate html
we createe a cart file and load it into the html
we store the data fro cart in add to cart element using data attribute
and modify the data in cart according to the preffered way
but some products may have same name so instead of produxt name we need to indentify them with id or we can generate id in html part
